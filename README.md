        GITHUB - It’s a Git repository hosting service, and exclusively cloud based. 
                 It’s an online database that allows you to keep track of and share your Git version control projects 
                 outside of your local computer/server. The codes can be shared with others, and allows other users to 
                 make revisions or edits  to the same file/code.

                 and recall branches.

                         differences in code between two commits.
                
        Fetch - This function downloads objects and refs from another repository.
