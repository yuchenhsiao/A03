    Tutorial
        
    The differences between Git and Github is that Git is an open source version control system, 
    it’s installed and maintained on your local system rather than in the cloud. It has the function for multiple 
    people to work on the same document at same time. While Github is a Git repository hosting service, and 
    exclusively cloud based. It’s an online database that allows you to keep track of and share your Git version 
    control projects outside of your local computer/server. The codes can be shared with others, and allows other 
    users to  make revisions or edits  to the same file/code. A repository is used to organize a project, 
    it can contain anything your project needs. 
        
    To use Git and Github, you would first need to intall webstorm. Webstorm is a Javascript IDE that can help the
    user to start working on the projects immediately insread of wasting times on figuring our the different 
    plugins. It helps the user write cleaner code, and increases the productivity. 
        
    You would first need to install Webstorm, then install Git as a local program. You would then create an account
    with Github and set up Github. You would then connect Github with Webstorm. You can do so by going to the system
    preferences in Webstorm, then select version control Git, and enter the path to the git.exe
        
    Then, you would add the Github password to Webstorm. You would do so by going to the system preferences then 
    select appearance and behavior -> system settings -> passwords. 
        
    Then, create a repository by clikcing the + sign in the upper right corner and choose create new repository.
    Click the READ.ME file then create. 
       
    You can create a repository from Webstorm by select VCS and import into version control. To import a repository 
    from Github you would first go to the main page adn select checkout from verisoin control -> Git. Or from 
    Webstorm select VSC -> checkout from version control -> Git. Then enter the Github repository name, then enter 
    the local path name. 
       
    To create a webstorm file. You would choose file -> HTML -> HTML5 or file -> Stylesheet. You would then add files
    to Git. You can do so by clicking add, and this will add it to the local system. 
        
    To save your changes, you would have to use the commit function. Commit save the chages on Github and each commit
    has a commit message that could tell the user why they saved the file at the time.
       
    Push helps send the changes to the master branch of the user’s repository. To push a change to remote repository, 
    you could first click control+shift+k or you could clikc VCS -> Git -> Push. By now, your file would be on Github.
    
    You can now set up your Github pagess by clicking on settings then check the repository name and chooese the Github
    page location. You can do so by selecting Master Branch(a branch allows users to create independent local branches 
    in their code. Which means user can try out new ideas, set aside branches for production work, jump back to earlier 
    branches, and easily delete, merge, and recall branches) then note the published URL.
    
    You can now check your Github pages by copying the Github.io URL into a browser, then post the URL into Canvas
    with your Github account URL.
    
    Below are some extra terms that are important to know:
    
    Commit - Saved changes on GitHub. Each commit has a commit message that could tell the user why they saved the
    file at the time.
                

    Pull - when you’ve made the changes in codes that you have copied and want to share them with its original order.
                
    Merge - This function helps join two or more development histories together. It happens happen when merging a 
    branch, rebasing a branch, or cherry picking a commit.
                
    Merge Conflict - A merge conflict is an event that occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences 
    in code between two commits.
                
    Fetch - This function downloads objects and refs from another repository.
                
    Remote - This command is used to connect your local repository to the remote server.
