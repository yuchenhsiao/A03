            GIT - an open source version control system, it’s installed and maintained on your local system rather than in the 
                  cloud. It has the function for multiple people to work on the same document at same time.
            
            GITHUB - it’s a Git repository hosting service, and exclusively cloud based. 
                     It’s an online database that allows you to keep track of and share your Git version control projects 
                     outside of your local computer/server. The codes can be shared with others, and allows other users to make 
                     revisions or edits  to the same file/code.

            Commit - saved changes on GitHub. Each commit has a commit message that could tell the user why they saved the

                     set aside branches for production work, jump back to earlier branches, and easily delete, merge, 
                     and recall branches.
